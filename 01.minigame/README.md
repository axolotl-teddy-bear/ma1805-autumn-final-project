When I was first brainstorming for this assessment, I wanted to create an extensive experience with 3 minigames, with the central theme of Chinese culture and traditions. I wanted to make a simulator of some sort, with the player taking my perspective in a family gathering dinner.

MiniGame no. 1: This is a minigame inspired by my experiences with my culture, especially with cuisine. It's a simulation of picking out 'unpleasant' parts of a dish--something I do a lot since I could be quite picky at times. The central idea of this game is for the player to pick out the unwanted parts within a certain time limit, and it should feel tense and stressful. 

MiniGame no. 2: This minigame is based on common interactions I would have with my relatives. With most Chinese families valuing wealth, status, and security, it is not unusual for relatives to hone in on private matters, especially during family gatherings. They ask questions about property ownership, relationship status, employment, finance, etc. I wanted to make a game that focused on being in the minds of the recipient when being asked these questions. The player's job is to figure out how to answer the question properly within a time limit. 

Minigame no. 3: This minigame is based on the idea of Chinese family trees and how they have a unique term to refer to every relative. The terms are very easy to mix up, so it is a struggle to recall which relative is which when I'm at a family gathering. The goal of the player is to determine who the relative is based on context clues. For example, distinguishing your third uncle from your niece, your grandparents from your cousin, etc., the distinguishing factors would be clothing, accessories, and most importantly, age.  

Together, these 3 mingames would be mashed together into a single experience. Whenever you successfully complete a game, a satisfaction meter goes up. When that meter is full,you win the game. 

P.S.: The idea I had was a bit ambitious. And, the mechanics I wanted to include took a lot longer than I anticipated to figure out. Due to personal reasons, I was not able to fulfill most of my plans regarding this project. However, minigame 01, which is the one I have completed, is still interesting in its own respects. If I had more resources to work on this project, I would probably hone in on the first mingame. I would make more dishes and "unpleasant food" assets. I could make the player cycle through the dishes and repeat the process of picking out the unwanted objects until a certain score is achieved or until the player naturally fails to keep up with the increasing difficulty.
